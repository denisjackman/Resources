<p>When yesterday's gone and tomorrow is near,<br />Why look for a thing when it's already here.<br />And tell me you never once asked yourself how<br />Some people end up in the middle of the now.<br />Now is the beat of the feet on the floor,<br />Now is the then we were all waiting for.<br />It's the strike of the luck.<br />It's the go with the flow.<br />It's the sharing the luck with the people we know.<br />See, a wise fool once said,<br />Kinda out of the blue,<br />That life is a dream<br />That's already come true.<br />It's less of the what and the where and the how,<br />It's more of the you and the me and the now.</p>
